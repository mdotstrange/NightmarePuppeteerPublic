##**OBSOLETE AS NP NOW INCLUDES IMPORTING OF 3d MODELS**


If you want to use a custom head or body in Nightmare Puppeteer you can send me the model and I
will process it and send it back to you. You can then upload it to Steam Workshop for everyone to use.

**Download these example files as a reference to make/mod your own bodies and heads**

* [Head fbx file](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/raw/master/Files/BlobHead.fbx)

* [Body fbx file](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/raw/master/Files/workoutWoman.fbx)

* For the heads they need to have a skinned jaw, only one joint/bone is really required and it **should rotate on its X axis**
to open/close the mouth- see the example file as a reference. The head can have a neck, that is up to you but a sausage neck will be added anyway.

* For the bodies they need to have a **Unity Humanoid/Mixamo compatible skeleton** or they will not work. **Remove the 
models head** before sending it please. Please keep the neck though. See the example file as a reference. 

* Please put your model, textures and a text file with your email address into a folder you add to the Dropbox
* ![this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/master/Files/ModelUpload.png)
* The email address is to send the processed model back to you so you can upload it to Workshop and maintain ownership of it

* Send me your head models using [Dropbox here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/iuxLfGnIaUohQm46mzeH)
* Send me your body models using [Dropbox here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/cgat97V4ziC2kswYdvIy)

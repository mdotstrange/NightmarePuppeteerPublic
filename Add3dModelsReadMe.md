* **TEMPORARY INFO PAGE**
* ------------------------------------------

* With all models use Embedded textures if you can otherwise make sure the texture files are in the same directory as the fbx you want to load like this...
* ![File example](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/raw/master/Files/FileTextures.png)
* *Importing can be pretty slow sometimes with character models(10-30 seconds). After adding a model to NP, NP will **NOT save it** so you can use it again after quitting. Instead I recommend **adding it to Steam Workshop. When you want to use it again just download it from Workshop.**

---------------
 **The following programs/sites exported fbx file formats are supported for bodies and heads**
 ** You can download example Fbx files from the different programs [here](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/releases/tag/ExampleFbxFiles) in the Releases.

----------------------
* **Mixamo**
* Models exported from Mixamo.com
* If you rig a model using mixamo and download it from Mixamo.com it should also work
* Mixamo rigs DO NOT have jaws so you can't use them for lip sync unless you add a jaw joint and skin it yourself. See [here](link to jaw examples) for details.

-----------------------------
* **iClone Character Creator**
* I don't own this and had a friend export it for me so I can't access the export settings sorry-

----------------------
 * **MakeHuman** - see tested export settings
 * ![MakeHUmanExport](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/raw/master/Files/MakeHUman2.jpg)
 * **YOU MUST USE the "Default no toes" rig for import to work correctly**
 * Notes- MakeHuman models will load in with textures correctly- if you upload them to workshop they will be missing their textures when downloaded from Workshop

----------------------------

* See [link to Rig Definer](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/releases/tag/v1.0) to use Unity models

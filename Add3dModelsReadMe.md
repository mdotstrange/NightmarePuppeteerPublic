**Information on importing 3d models into NP**

* *With all models use Embedded textures if you can otherwise make sure the texture files are in the same directory as the fbx you want to load like this...
* ![File example](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/raw/master/Files/FileTextures.png)

 **The following programs/sites exported fbx file formats are supported for bodies and heads**
 ----------------
 
 * **Daz Studio** - see tested export settings
 * ![DazExportImage](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/raw/master/Files/DazOptions.png)

* **Mixamo**
* Models exported from Mixamo.com
* If you rig a model using mixamo and download it from Mixamo.com it should also work

* **Iclone Character Creator**
* I don't own this and had a friend export it for me so I can't access the export settings sorry-

 * **MakeHuman** - see tested export settings
 * ![MakeHUmanExport](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/raw/master/Files/MakeHUman2.jpg)
 * Notes- MakeHuman models will load in with textures correctly- if you upload them to workshop they will be missing their textures when downloaded from Workshop

* **Unity** - all humanoid characters should work
* See [link to Rig Definer](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/releases/tag/v1.0) to use Unity models

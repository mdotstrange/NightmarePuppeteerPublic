**About importing and using your own .fbx prop models**

Download and use the Example Prop Fbx file [here](https://github.com/mdotstrange/NightmarePuppeteerPublic/blob/master/Files/ExampleFbxFileImport.fbx) as a reference. Take note of its size and orientation.
Your file should be in the same size range. The +Z axis is the props forward facing direction.

* Use Fbx 2013 or older
* Textures are supported
* P/S/R animation supported
* Skinned meshes/deformation is not supported (this means you can't use character models that deform etc)
* Upon import Nightmare Puppeteer will add a Collider to your Model and make it available as an actor prop AND inside the Lousy Level Editor.
